Prototype "thin" jar launcher for java apps. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1813 for more discussion and ideas.

TODO:

* [X] Support the wrapper as a layout in Spring Boot build plugins
* [X] Extract `AetherEngine` and re-use it in Spring Boot CLI(*)
* [X] Close old PR and send a new one for custom layouts in build plugin
* [X] Deploy jars to snapshot repo at repo.spring.io
* [X] Make it easy to override the dependencies at runtime (e.g. rolling upgrades of library jars for security patches)
* [X] Add a "dry run" or "download only" feature so grab the dependencies and warm up the local cache, but not run the app
* [X] Hone the dependencies in the launcher a bit (some optional stuff probably still there)
* [X] Either autogenerate the `thin.properties` or find a way to model the pom without a lot of extra machinery
* [X] Worry about the other stuff on the classpath of the launcher (e.g. spring-core)
* [X] Make it work in Cloud Foundry
* [ ] Work with Ben to make it a nice experience in Cloud Foundry
* [X] Support for boms
* [X] Support for exclusions
* [ ] Support for configuring launcher via manifest and/or properties file
* [X] Support for configuring wrapper via env vars  and/or properties file
* [X] Generate `thin.properties` during build (e.g. to support Gradle)
* [ ] Experiment with "container" apps and multi-tenant/ephemeral child contexts
* [X] Deployment time support for the dry run to assist with CI pipelines

(*) Implemented in Spring Boot, not in this project.

## Getting Started

Build this project locally:

```
$ ./mvnw clean install
```

Then run the "app" jar:

```
$ java -jar ./app/target/*.jar
```

(It starts an empty Spring Boot app with Tomcat.)

## How does it Work?

Inspect the "app" jar. It is just a regular jar file with the app
classes in it and two extra features:

1. The `ThinJarWrapper` class has been added.
2. A `META-INF/thin.properties` which lists the dependencies of the app.

When the app runs the main method is in the `ThinJarWrapper`. Its job
is to download another jar file that you just built (the "launcher"),
or locate it in your local Maven repo if it can. The wrapper downloads
the launcher (if it needs to), or else uses the cached version in your
local Maven repository.

The launcher then takes over and reads the `thin.properties`,
downloading the dependencies (and all transitives) as necessary, and
setting up a new class loader with them all on the classpath. It then
runs the application's own main method with that class loader. If the
`thin.properties` is not there then the `pom.xml` is used instead (it
can be in the root of the jar or in the standard `META-INF/maven`
location).

The app jar in the demo is build using the Spring Boot plugin and a
custom `Layout` (so it only builds with Spring Boot 1.5.x),

## Caching

All jar files are cached in the local Maven repository, so if you are
building and running the same app repeatedly, it should be faster
after the first time, or if the local repo is already warm.

The local repository can be re-located by setting a System property
"thin.root". For example to use the current directory:

```
$ java -Dthin.root=. -jar app/target/*.jar
```

This will download all the dependencies to `${thin.root}/repository`,
and look for Maven settings in `${thin.root}/settings.xml`.

You can also do a "dry run", just to warm up the cache and not run the
app, by setting a System property "thin.dryrun" (to any value). In
fact, since you don't need the application code for this (except the
`META-INF/thin.properties`), you could run only the launcher, or the
wrapper, which might be a useful trick for laying down a file system
layer in a container image, for example.

> NOTE: options for the `ThinJarLauncher` that are listed as
> `-Dthin.*` can also be provided as command line arguments
> (`--thin.*` per Spring Boot conventions), or as environment
> variables (`THIN_*` capitalized and underscored). The command line
> options are removed before passing down to the Boot app. The
> `ThinJarWrapper` accepts system properties or environment variables
> for its (smaller) set of optional arguments.

## Upgrades and Profiles

You can upgrade all the libraries by changing the
`thin.properties`. You can also read a local `thin.properties` from
the current working directory, or set a System property `thin.name` to
change the local file name (defaults to `thin`). There is also a
`thin.profile` (comma separated list) which is appended to
`thin.name`, so additional libraries can be added using
`thin-{profile}.properties`. Profile-specific properties are loaded
last so they take precedence. You can exclude and remove dependencies
by prepending a key in the properties file with `exlcusions.`.

## Packaging

The thin-launcher provides its own custom layout for the Spring Boot
plugins. If this layout is used then the jar built by Spring Boot will
be executable and thin.

### Maven

```xml
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>${spring-boot.version}</version>
				<configuration>
					<layout>THIN</layout>
				</configuration>
				<dependencies>
					<dependency>
						<groupId>org.springframework.boot.experimental</groupId>
						<artifactId>spring-boot-thin-launcher</artifactId>
						<version>${wrapper.version}</version>
					</dependency>
				</dependencies>
			</plugin>
```

There is also a Maven plugin which can be used to do the dry run
(download and cache the dependencies) for the current project, or for
any project that has an executable thin jar in the same format. The
"app" sample in this repo declares this plugin and inserts it into
the "package" lifecycle:

```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot.experimental</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-thin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>${wrapper.version}</version>
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<id>resolve</id>
			<goals>
				<goal>resolve</goal>
			</goals>
			<inherited>false</inherited>
		</execution>
	</executions>
</plugin>
```

After running the build, there is a deployable warm-cache at
`target/thin/root` (by default):

```
$ cd samples/app
$ mvn package
$ cd target/thin/root
$ java -Dthin.root=. -jar app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The "simple" sample has the same feature, but it also downloads and
warms up the cache for the "app" sample, so you could use the same
build to run both apps if you felt like it.

### Gradle

```groovy
buildscript {
	ext {
		springBootVersion = '1.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT'
		wrapperVersion = '0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT'
	}
	repositories {
		mavenLocal()
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath("org.springframework.boot.experimental:spring-boot-thin-gradle-plugin:${wrapperVersion}")
		classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springBootVersion}")
	}
}
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot.experimental.thin-launcher'
```

With this plugin in place to generate the thin jar, the result is an executable jar with a footprint of about 8kb:

```
$ cd samples/simple
$ gradle build
$ java -jar build/libs/simple-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

A "dry run" can be executed in Gradle by calling the "thinResolve"
task (defined by the plugin above), e.g.

```
$ cd samples/simple
$ gradle thinResolve
$ cd build/thin/deploy
$ java -Dthin.root=. -jar simple-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The default location for the cache is `build/thin/root` but this was
changed in the `build.gradle` for that sample:

```
thinResolvePrepare {
	into new File("${buildDir}/thin/deploy")
}
```

## Creating the Metadata

### Maven

A `pom.xml` works just fine to drive the dependency resolution, so
Maven projects can just rely on that. If you want to generate a
properties file there are a few options.

There's an existing maven plugin that can list dependencies into a
properties file. We could support it's format as well as or instead of
thin.properties. Example:

```xml
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.servicemix.tooling</groupId>
				<artifactId>depends-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id></id>
						<phase>prepare-package</phase>
						<goals>
							<goal>generate-depends-file</goal>
						</goals>
						<inherited>false</inherited>
						<configuration>
						</configuration>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
```

Also there is the `effective-pom`, which is easy to generate and can be transformed using XSLT (for example).

### Gradle

There doesn't seem to be an equivalent plugin in Gradle land, so the
thin launcher plugin creates the `thin.properties` file. It is
activated just by putting it in the classpath and then applying the
plugin (as in the example above).

### Generating a POM

Instead of the `thin.properties` you can generate a pom in Gradle:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'maven'

task writePom << {
	pom {}.withXml{ 
		dependencyManagement.pomConfigurer.configurePom (it.asNode())
	}.writeTo("$buildDir/resources/main/pom.xml")
}

jar.dependsOn = [writePom]
```

There are some problems with the generated poms (e.g. exclusions are
not generated correctly). Using the dependency management section of
the build config works a little better, e.g instead of this:

```groovy
configurations { compile.exclude module: 'spring-boot-starter-tomcat' }
```

(per the Spring Boot user guide), use this:

```groovy
dependencyManagement {
	dependencies {
		dependency("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:${springBootVersion}") { exclude 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat' }
	}
}
```

## Classpath Computation

The launcher has some optional arguments that result in classpath
computations, instead of running the Boot app. E.g.

```
$ java -jar myapp.jar --thin.classpath
```

prints out (on stdout) a class path in the form that can be used
directly in `java -cp`. So this is a way to run the app from its main
method (which iis slightly faster than using the launcher):

```
$ CLASSPATH=`java -jar myapp.jar --thin.classpath`
$ java -cp "$CLASSPATH:myapp.jar" demo.MyApplication
```

You can also compute the classpath using explicit name and profile parameters:

```
$ java -jar myapp.jar --thin.classpath --thin.name=app --thin.profile=dev
```

will look for `app.properties` and `app-dev.properties` to list the dependencies.

You can also specify a "parent" archive which is used to calculate a
prefix for the classpath. Two apps that share a parent then have the
same prefix, and can share classes using `-Xshare:on`. For example:

```
$ CP1=`java -jar myapp.jar --thin.classpath`
$ CP2=`java -jar otherapp.jar --thin.classpath --thin.parent=myapp.jar`

$ java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+UseAppCDS -Xshare:off \
  -XX:DumpLoadedClassList=app.classlist \
  -noverify -cp $CP1:myapp.jar demo.MyApplication
$ java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+UseAppCDS -Xshare:dump \
  -XX:SharedArchiveFile=app.jsa -XX:SharedClassListFile=app.classlist \
  -noverify -cp $CP1

$ java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+UseAppCDS -Xshare:on \
  -XX:SharedArchiveFile=app.jsa -noverify -cp $CP1:myapp.jar demo.MyApplication 
$ java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+UseAppCDS -Xshare:on \
  -XX:SharedArchiveFile=app.jsa -noverify -cp $CP1:otherapp.jar demo.OtherApplication
```

the two apps at the end are sharing class data from `app.jsa` and will
also start up faster (e.g. 6s startup goes down to 4s for
a vanilla Eureka Server).
