The main purpose of this test app is to use some sanpshot dependency that is NOT availabe in the spring-snapshot repository which is added by default.
(See "https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" in DependencyResolver.)
So, it is possible to test the configuration of such a snapshot repository in settings.xml.
